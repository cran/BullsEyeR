1,"As global competition and technological changes make their force felt on industries, it can be hard for businesses to focus on anything beyond immediate survival. Some have survived and thrived over decades and even centuries. We explore the secret to achieving corporate longevity.
Corporate history is littered with examples of large companies that have been hugely successful in their industries for years but, at some point, go into crisis and go under. They might have been a familiar part of the corporate landscape for a generation, but the seemingly unthinkable happens and they go into decline. This should hardly come as a surprise. The fact is: corporate mortality is more common than corporate longevity.

Changes in company listings give a clue to corporate death rates. According to research conducted by Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan in their book ‘Creative Destruction’, of the 500 top companies listed by S&P in 1957, only 74 still existed 40 years later.  A look to the future is more disconcerting still. According to Foster, by 2027 more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 will be companies we have not heard of yet.

Company lifespans are getting shorter
The pace of change is accelerating; from 1958 to 2011 the average lifespan of top companies dropped from 61 years to 18.  Corporate longevity is the exception, not the norm. What does it take for a company to buck this trend, to survive and remain relevant in our highly competitive, fast-changing global economy not just over years, but over the very long run? What can we learn from those companies that succeed in achieving this feat? How have they succeeded where so many others failed? Are they more innovative and willing to adapt, or are they particularly resilient? Does their enduring strength derive from strong leadership or is it embedded in the company’s culture? Whatever the secret ingredient is, how is it passed on to successive generations?

Is there a single answer to longevity?
“If I knew the answer to this question, I would be a very rich man,” says Leslie Hannah, Professor of Business History at the London School of Economics. Hannah has studied corporate longevity in detail during his career. His 1999 paper ‘Marshall’s “Trees” and the Global “Forest”: Were “Giant Redwoods” Different?’ tracks the histories of the big international companies of the 20th century.  Starting with the 100 largest companies in the world in 1912, as measured by market capitalisation, the paper finds that, by 1995, nearly half had disappeared and, of those that survived, only 19 remained in the top 100.

Longevity is no guarantee for future survival
Hannah now lives in Japan, home to some of the oldest companies in the world, a few of which can look back on a history spanning more than 1,000 years. Amongst them were, until relatively recently, a Buddhist temple construction company called Kongo Gumi. Established in 578, it laid claim to being the oldest continuously operating family-owned business in the world, with ownership passing from one generation to the next for 1,428 years. It survived many hard times, but in 2006, faced with mounting debt and declining demand for temples, it went into liquidation. The fact is, extreme longevity is no guarantee for continued survival, so what is?

Transferring knowledge is key
Around the world there are examples of small, usually family-owned businesses that can claim to have survived over centuries, such as the Hotel Interlaken in Switzerland, first mentioned in 1323, or the watchmaker Gallet & Co, dating back to 1466. But what does it take for a large international company to survive? Hannah concluded in his study that one key to success was the ability to ‘operate distinctively’ in order to have and retain a competitive edge, but equally important is the ability to escape the constraints of individual markets by using your capabilities to transfer to new industries. Many corporate deaths are caused by an inability to do this.

Changing with the times
Hannah gives examples of large coal, textiles, and railroad manufacturing companies that dominated the world in the early 20th century, but collapsed when technology moved on and their markets dried up. They had no relevant capabilities to transfer to new industries. “Every company that survives undergoes some sort of transition,” explains Hannah. “But some changes are more radical than others.” He gives the example of the American Can Company, which made its name in the first half of the 20th century in the then new tech area of tin cans. When it saw how plastic was replacing tin, it succeeded in shifting industries altogether, leaving manufacturing and entering financial services. “A company that changes nothing in a changing world won’t last long,” says Hannah. “But any transformation has to be built on existing capabilities – this is the reason why the stock exchange will provide the funds.” In other words, companies that succeed in surviving major changes in the economy do so by striking the balance between staying true to their core competencies and also by changing with the times.

Companies can’t afford to stay still
Cyril Bouquet, Professor of Strategy at IMD (International Institute for Management Development), a Swiss business school, works with large companies with a long history that are reinventing themselves to stay relevant into the future. He agrees that no company can afford to stand still. He has also carried out an analysis of company lifespans. “Out of the top 100 companies that existed in 1900, only one is still in existence in exactly the same shape and form today, that company is Ford Motors,” he says. “There are 16 others still in existence, but when you look at them you can’t be sure it’s still the same company.” The conclusion Bouquet draws from this is, if you want to be around for the long term, you need to evolve. “We can find only one example of a company that has stayed very close to what it was and has managed to survive. The other 16 companies that survived evolved a lot. The others have simply disappeared. They weren’t small companies. They were the top companies in the world at the time.”

At this point it may be worth asking whether a certain amount of corporate death isn’t healthy for the economy. Economist Joseph Schumpeter described the innovative character of capitalism as ‘creative destruction’ – incessantly destroying the old economic structure while creating a new one. There is clearly something attractive in this idea. We only have to look to the dynamic entrepreneurial culture in the US – a country that fosters innovation and thrives on the new. It is based on the premise that if a new business idea doesn’t work, you close it down and move on. Yet as we destroy the old to create the new, what gets lost along the way?

In with the new and out with the old?
“Sometimes it’s best for a system to run its course so that you can create a new one without all of the rigidities that are built in the old system that is trying to survive,” explains Bouquet. But not all destruction is good. “When you destroy, you destroy a lot of good things, such as the great abilities and skills that have been developed over time. There is a tendency to think longevity is not important, that the market will take care of things. What that view neglects is the good things that are lost in the process of destruction.” It is not just the skills and abilities, but the social cost and trauma caused by job losses. There is a ripple effect when a big company goes under.

Bouquet is a self-confessed proponent of longevity, provided the process of evolution can be facilitated. His definition of the long term is very long indeed – he encourages executives to think beyond their own lifetimes, to imagine how their companies can continue to be relevant a century from now.

Most big companies are afraid of change
But how many companies are able to do this? “Very few,” says Bouquet. “The reality is that most big companies are not structured in a way that allows this to happen – there is so much about the way that they act and think that prevents them from adapting to the world.” In his work with leading French companies such as SNCL, Veolia, La Poste, and Carrefour, he has seen that, while they want to reinvent themselves to adapt to the demands of today’s markets, they are afraid of losing their ‘soul’ in the process – of becoming a different company altogether. He understands this fear. “It’s not just about replacing an old world with a new one, but being able to marry different logics.”

Bouquet explains that the logic of the past is just as important as you move into the future, but it comes with rigidities that need to be eliminated. “Finding the balance is not easy.” There are clearly some industries where change comes more naturally than others. The worlds of fashion and media are heady and fast paced – what is ‘in’ today may be ‘out’ tomorrow, and that is precisely what customers in these markets value.

History is important in banking
Banking, it could be argued, is at the other end of the spectrum. “One thing you want when you put your money in a bank is some sense of certainty you might get it back,” says Hannah. “This is why you are likely to favour one that’s been going on 100 years, over one that’s just opened.” A bank may be proud of being highly innovative and high tech, but alongside this it will also emphasise its long history, not just to celebrate an impressive achievement but to inspire customer confidence in its future performance.

Some industries are so new that rapid and dramatic change is part and parcel of doing business in these sectors. Many of today’s high tech giants operate in markets that didn’t even exist as recently as 10 years ago. Digital businesses such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Instagram have come from nowhere and ballooned to become household names almost overnight. But the same forces that have enabled them to grow so quickly can also lead to their swift demise, because barriers to entering the digital world are lower than in the world of real physical infrastructure.

Know your competition
Competition can take any of today’s incumbents by surprise and render them irrelevant at lightning speed. Look at what happened to MySpace. In the new digital business sector, survival over years, rather than decades, should be considered impressive. So can any of these companies hope to still be here in 125 years’ time? Looking beyond the here and now is the key to sustainability “Google is an interesting case,” says Bouquet. “The way they think about what they are trying to do means they could be there for a very long time.” Bouquet is talking about Google’s long-term strategy, which has seen it, in recent months; explore opportunities in robotics, self-driving cars, and anti-ageing technologies. For a company that depends almost entirely on one revenue stream – online advertising – this is not just visionary; it might one day be essential to its survival. They know that relying on a single source of income is risky, so they are using their current economic muscle to build capabilities in what might become the billion dollar industries of the future.

Bouquet explains: “It’s not about predicting the future; it’s about trying to decide what sort of future you want to build – what sort of company you want to become.” At the heart of this process are values. In order to define where the journey is going, a company has to know why it exists, what its purpose is. If it is clear on this, then it can define what sort of company it wants to be. “For Google, it’s about seeing itself as a company that can leverage technology to solve big problems and make people’s lives richer and easier.”

Have a very long-term vision
The visioning process is fundamental to long-term survival, and Google isn’t the first to employ it. “Look at Nestlé,” says Bouquet. “When they decided to move from being a food and drink company to being a leader in nutrition health and well-being, they engaged interested parties around the company on a 30-year journey. They were trying to define what sort of company Nestlé would become and what success could look like 30 years down the line.” In the 1970s, Nestlé had already been around over 100 years. However, recognising that radical change was taking place in their markets, they began diversifying first into skincare and then pharmaceutical products. By 2005, Nestlé’s chairman made clear that the company’s direction was towards becoming a provider of products and services in the areas of nutrition, health and well-being, and in 2010 they announced the creation of Nestlé Health Science and the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, aimed at the prevention and treatment of chronic medical conditions with science-based, personalised nutrition solutions.

Executives should think “marathon” not “sprint”
But to return to our opening premise, in a world of global competition and fast-paced change, who has the luxury to devote time to this sort of question? Bouquet acknowledges that this is difficult. His research shows that most executives spend as much as 90 percent of their time on the present and only 10 percent thinking about the future. “They are running a series of sprints,” he says. “But you can’t run a series of sprints without running out of breath. To be sure, you need to win the sprint – there’s no way of avoiding it – but you also need to win the longer race, the race for relevance in the long term.” Therefore, time must be devoted to looking to the future.

Longevity is not a “one man show”
Bouquet is equally adamant that the job of creating the future cannot be the exclusive responsibility of a single great leader or management team. “A lot of companies fail because they’ve had charismatic leaders, but when those leaders leave, they never really recover.” Many people have wondered how long Apple can thrive beyond Steve Jobs. According to Bouquet, a company that wishes to survive over the long term needs to instil a culture of co-creation amongst its employees – that they are all responsible for visioning the future. Hannah, by contrast, describes how companies successful in the long-term continue to retain a competitive edge from operating distinctively by transmitting ‘tacit learning’ down through managerial generations. “It has to be tacit because if it can be codified or written down, it can be taught to others outside the company and the competitive advantage is lost,” he says. “At companies successful over the long term, there is an understanding which is just ‘in the air’ and understood by the participants – it can’t be copied.”

The future is created today
Addressing the future today will save a company tomorrow It is tempting to conclude that corporate longevity comes down to a mixture of luck – the time and industry a business operates in – and an elusive secret; something individual to those who succeed that by definition cannot be copied. But what Bouquet suggests is that it’s also in a mind-set and a clear and concerted approach to the future. Companies have to be willing to take a long-term view. “Yes, it is difficult and there are low incentives for doing so,” he acknowledges. “You never know if what you are doing today to create a long term future is going to be right or wrong. There’s always a temptation to believe that the future will be created by the people who come next. But actually that’s not true, the future is created today.” When a company celebrates an anniversary – whether it be 10, 50 or 100 years – it should not only use the occasion to look back and celebrate milestones, but rather envision what it might look like in years to come."
2,"Darcy Winslow is one of the foremost experts in steering a large, successful company toward greater environmental sustainability. Her pioneering work at Nike in the 1990s brought about fundamental changes in many of the company’s attitudes and practices toward the environment. She explains what it took to do this and the urgent challenges that lay ahead.
In the 1990s, you initiated Nike’s sustainability programme long before many other large companies were thinking about these issues. What inspired you to do it?

It started with the personal. I had experienced health issues and discovered that my problems were likely caused by chemicals in our environment. They had been deemed safe at the time, but five years later they were banned because of their toxicity. Back then I was running Advanced Research and Development at Nike. I started to ask myself whether there was a bigger impact I could make in the world, beyond developing the next cool product. About that time, we were asked at Nike if we knew what chemicals were in our shoes. We had to say that we didn’t. That day opened up a new world for me. I realised that sustainability efforts could not come from corporate social responsibility alone. I went to the then president of Nike and said, “If we are going to make this happen, it has to happen within the business. He said, ‘OK, go figure it out.’”

Your success at Nike was in aligning organisational values with the development and implementation of practical, systemic, sustainable design strategies. What were the hurdles and how did you overcome them?

At the time, people thought of sustainability only in terms of sustaining business growth. I had to learn to interpret this new concept for people, to engage them in a conversation around what it is and why Nike should take it on. Environmental issues were nowhere on the list of traits that create brand loyalty. I had to develop a business case for Nike being a first mover in this area. To begin with I got nowhere. So I looked at who the heroes were in the system. At Nike it was the designers. Translating the concept of sustainability into innovation helped my colleagues listen and engage. As an example, one of our goals was ‘zero waste’. We calculated that the waste created in making a single pair of running shoes equated to a third shoe’s worth of material. We asked: ‘How do we turn that around’? So instead of saying: ‘You can’t do this or that’ – which just did not mesh with the culture – we worked with the designers to develop design for environment principles that started a whole host of innovation around materials and design. The results are evident today, as one example, in Nike’s Flyknit.

How did you bring external stakeholders on board?

Another of our goals was ‘zero toxics’. To tackle this we had to go upstream to our materials suppliers. Our largest supplier at the time was Dupont. We had to find common goals and values with them. Once we’d done that, it opened the door. After a year of discussions they agreed to sign on. They would identify which chemicals were in the products, which allowed us to begin drafting a restricted substance list, identify environmentally preferred materials, and create a toolkit for designers and product engineers to draw from. With Dupont on board, we had leverage with other suppliers.

Today you are the Managing Partner for the Academy for Systemic Change. What is its purpose?

The Academy is made up of people from around the globe who are focused on awareness-based systemic change. We say ‘awareness-based’ because it starts with the self – the success of an intervention is completely dependent on the inner state of the intervener. Some of the domains we initially focused on were transforming education, marine ecosystems and fisheries, agriculture and food, alternative banking, women’s empowerment, sustainable communities, and tropical rainforests. It’s our goal to build the capacity of other practitioners, leaders, and the community. We share access to all of our networks, and incubate and create hubs in the domains we’re focused on. The goal is to continue to scale up the number of emerging leaders that have the commitment, the aspirations, and the capability to lead at the systems level.

Looking at where we are today, how optimistic are you?

Going back 30 years, sustainability was a new word. Today, the term ‘sustainability’ is widely understood. But if you score our efforts on a scale of 1 to 5 – where 1 is just being compliant, and 5 is where you redesign financial systems and sustainability is baked into everything you do, your visions and your principles – most companies and organisations are operating at about level 2. It’s not strategic, it’s more volunteer efforts. All this is important, but these are just drops in the ocean. We need more collaboration, like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition from my own industry, which has come together around the water challenge. You can’t transform a system by pulling one lever. It takes everyone picking up a rein and pulling in a new direction.

Can we achieve sustainable growth in consumption without sacrificing our standard of living, and what does this mean for investors?

We are currently using around 1.5 Earths’ worth of natural resources and we only have one Earth. Increasing affluence, the growth of the middle classes and consumption patterns based on a western life style are the things that will take us down if we don’t do something about it. We can’t assume growth can go on exponentially forever. Getting to a circular economy where we’re not drawing on virgin natural resources, that is the challenge. With all due respect, are we investing for short-term growth and gain for some, or are we making investments in our long-term ability not just to survive but to thrive, for everyone? "
3,"Nanotech is everywhere – an enabler across all industries that promises advances in all facets of society. This science of small things is unlocking opportunities over a wide range of products and applications, from healthcare to energy and manufacturing, to name but a few. Aymeric Sallin, the founder of NanoDimension, is convinced that companies that move the science from the lab into the commercial sector have the potential to become the blue chips of tomorrow.
According to Aymeric Sallin, the CEO of venture capital firm NanoDimension, the science of nanotechnology is about to impact traditional technologies on a scale similar to the way Uber is revolutionising the taxi industry in our cities today. And he should know. As the head of a firm that invests at an early stage in companies using breakthrough nanotechnology, he understands how working at the atomic and molecular level is about to change the global technological landscape.
 
Sallin has specialised in taking science out of the laboratory and into the sphere of manufacturing since he launched his company in 2002. He believes that breakthrough science must be converted into disruptive technology to help revolutionise entire marketplaces. “I love what I do: translating science from the lab into successful companies that sell products with the power to reshape entire industries. Those technologies also help solve some of the biggest challenges in society,” explains Sallin, who is a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum.

Success is all about fusion

His history of fusing his passions with entrepreneurship began when he launched his first company while studying physical engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Back then in the early 1990s, his passion was snowboarding, and he aspired to become a professional until he was thwarted by injury.

But Sallin refused to let his injuries end his relationship with the sport, so he founded a company that would keep him close to the slopes and his fellow athletes. “The company managed a team of professional snowboarders,” he explains. “We won 12 European and World titles between ’96 and ’98, shot movies on volcanoes and big mountains, and competed around the world. It was a wonderful escape from the labs and classrooms.” After completing his laboratory work at EPFL, Sallin pursued a career as a strategy consultant at the global management consultancy Bain & Co. From there, his passion for nanotechnology and entrepreneurship moved him to create the first-ever venture capital firm focused on nanotechnology. “The best way for me to contribute to the emergence of this sector was not with consulting or advice, but with capital to enable entrepreneurs to set up and build their companies,” he explains. As a result, Sallin started NanoDimension back in 2002.

Taking risks

He recalls it was tough to begin with. It was just after the Internet bubble had burst, and investors were not keen on taking risks in an emerging field with a new team that had no track record. “Metaphorically, I had to break my head through a wall of challenges. It was either my head or the wall that would eventually break. Luckily, in my case, it was the wall that ended up breaking first. It took about four years of team building, deal-flow cultivation, business model development, and pitching the promise of nanotech to just about anyone who would listen,” says Sallin. Today, he explains, he has teams in Switzerland and Silicon Valley, and with several hundred millions of dollars deployed globally, NanoDimension is the largest venture capital firm specialising in nanotechnology.

It was the American physicist Richard Feynman who in 1959 first suggested the possibility of manipulating atoms and molecules. By 1981 nanoscale science had become a reality with the development of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope. Things have moved on significantly since then.

“Today, we are able to organise atoms and design molecules the way we want and need,” Sallin explains. “This gives scientists an unprecedented level of control, and allows them to exploit the change of physical properties that occurs at the nanoscale.” This ability to organise atoms and design molecules has opened the door to applications that no one could ever have imagined just a few years ago. These include more efficient, targeted drugs and vaccines, new water treatment systems, next-generation energy production and storage devices, and many more.

Targeted treatments

Nano-enabled products have made significant contributions to the development of more effective medicines. NanoDimension has several biopharmaceutical firms in its investment portfolio that focus on the development of new therapies for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, and other diseases.

One example is ARMO BioSciences, a biopharmaceutical company that has a leading programme in Phase I clinical trials, and has treated over 200 patients in under two years. “The research process can move forward so fast because existing components (or molecules) can be used and then repackaged using nanotechnology,” explains Sallin. “These targeted treatments can circulate within the human body, accumulate at disease sites, and deliver their payload more effectively, right where it’s needed. This is not science fiction; we currently have several companies involved in clinical trials in the US.”

As an example, he shows an X-ray of a patient’s triple negative breast cancer tumour and points out: “Nearly 90 percent of this tumour had disappeared four weeks after being treated with one of the drugs in the clinical trials that I just mentioned.” He hopes to have these treatments approved by the health authorities and commercialised in the near future.

Nanotech today and tomorrow

Nanotechnology is also being used to develop materials and devices that emulate human biology. These devices combine aspects of nanotechnology from the physical and life sciences, and enable living human cells or blood to grow in micro-engineered environments that mimic physiological conditions better than traditional methods. This technology provides a window into the inner workings of the human body, and can be used to predict the human response to drug treatments, chemicals or foods with greater precision than traditional cell cultures or animal-based testing. “This could well become the ultimate personalised medicine of the future, as one could test potential treatments in personalised chips before moving to the patient,” Sallin predicts.

In countries such as Israel and Singapore, waste water is recycled many times for reuse. Existing nanofiber technology is already being used to eliminate as much as 99 percent of contaminants including viruses and bacteria. However, hormonal compounds from agriculture and industrial waste also make their way into the waste water and aren’t removed by current treatments. This can cause major disruption to entire ecosystems. “There are rivers where all the fish are female and regions where girls are fertile at the age of eight. If we can functionalise nanoparticles to identify cancer cells in the human body, there is no doubt in my mind that we can also soon do this with functionalised nanomembranes that remove these compounds,” Sallin says.

Global population growth, changing demographics, and urbanisation are all set to put extreme pressure on our existing energy resources, and nanotechnology can also help to ease some of these pressures. “Climate change and exploding energy demands are a reality. We are the last generation that can do something to reverse these trends,” says Sallin. Storing electrons and converting photons all happens at the nanoscale. More efficient batteries, solar cells, CO2 capture technologies, and other energy-related solutions will all be based on nanotechnology.

Unleashing disruptive technology

Nanotechnology has large-scale applications in both energy storage and solar power generation. Using nanomaterials for lithium-ion batteries, for example, could extend the storage capacity of batteries. The use of nanomaterials could also significantly increase the light harvesting and energy generation capacity of solar cells. As both batteries and renewable energies become more efficient and cheaper, demand is likely to continue to rise in the coming years. The technology also has a part to play in creating sustainable cities. View Dynamic Glass, also part of NanoDimension’s portfolio, has created glass with an electrochromic coating inside that can be tinted on demand to control how much light and heat enter a building, without losing visibility. By applying an electrical current, ions move between multiple layers coated onto the glass to keep out unwanted glare and heat, while reducing the overall energy consumption of a building by as much as 20 percent. This precise, adjustable environmental control results in increased occupant comfort, which Sallin explains can influence everything from patient recovery in hospitals to employee performance at work.

Bringing science out of the laboratory and into production takes time, infrastructure, and capital. For View Dynamic Glass, it took around eight years. But Sallin believes the rewards are worth it. One factory has the potential to make USD 125 million profit per production line annually, he says, while it costs just USD 100 million to build. So if one estimates that 10 percent of new commercial buildings worldwide will be fitted with dynamic glass, one would need about 500 factories just to meet demand. “This is exactly what nanotechnology is about: disrupting an entire sector, addressing a real problem, and evolving into a massive player,” explains Sallin.

The nanotechnology market is expanding fast. Last year, for example, the global market for nanotechnology products was valued at around USD 26 billion, according to an estimate by BCC Research. The market research company RNCOS predicts that the nanotech market will increase to USD 76 billion by 2020. Sallin is confident that nanotechnology is not destined to become the next dotcom bubble. “The first generation of nanotechnology is already here, and it’s starting to impact every industry. It will get bigger every year for decades to come.” He knows that it will not all be smooth sailing. In Europe, he says, there is a tendency to focus on the potential risk presented by new technologies, while in the US regulators are treating new nanotechnology applications with caution. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a special programme on nanoparticles and nanostructures to check potential toxicity. “The scientific community takes these safety aspects very seriously,” says Sallin.

And yet, despite such enormous potential today, Sallin had to expand his company into the US because of a lack of compelling investment opportunities in Europe. With teams in Switzerland and Silicon Valley, NanoDimension now benefits from a global deal flow, and leverages infrastructure and talent wherever they are. “There is no shortage of brilliant scientists and leading universities in Europe, but unlike the US, they lack infrastructure, technicians, entrepreneurs, and a risk culture.”

Silicon Valley sets the standards

Sallin would like to see policymakers around the world understand what fundamental innovation means today, and what it requires, not just theoretically, but also on a practical level. He underscores that the globalisation of technology requires that science should move quickly out of the lab into an environment that facilitates scale, manufacturing, and commercialisation. “Companies and teams sometimes have to relocate to leverage infrastructure and talent at various stages,” he explains.

He fears that Europe is too dependent on funding doctoral grants through research budgets rather than focusing on the creation of manufacturing and commercialisation hubs that support ecosystems for innovation; this is a process that will take time. “Without leveraging Silicon Valley, we would not have been able to convert the science into technology,” Sallin explains.

Large-scale manufacturing can be located anywhere. Europe and Switzerland need to be ready to open up to opportunities to establish high-tech manufacturing centres and create high-value manufacturing jobs to keep up. “These high-tech hubs of manufacturing could establish the ecosystem where innovation happens, just as it does in Silicon Valley.”

The best piece of advice that Sallin could give to someone interested in entering the nanotech market is to look at it very pragmatically and with a product-focused approach. “Ask yourself, do I get a much better value proposition for my product, an order-of-magnitude cost advantage, and a much more efficient manufacturing process than with other competing technologies? If the answer is yes, go for it and don’t get distracted by all of the other things that this technology could achieve.”"
4,"The number and proportion of older individuals is growing faster than any other age group, and will surpass 1 billion within a decade. These changing demographics are linked with risks and opportunities. Long-term, it is likely that the successful companies of the future are those that understand the needs of the silver consumers.
The ageing population is an unavoidable shift in the world’s demographics. In 2000, for the first time in history, there was more people over-60 than children under the age of five. The number and proportion of older persons is growing faster than any other age group and will surpass 1 billion people within the next decade. By 2050, the number of mature consumers is expected to have doubled to 2 billion. The main drivers behind this global phenomenon – increased life expectancy and declining fertility rates – planted their roots more than 50 years ago. The impact of these two trends on demographics in the developed and the developing world cannot be unwound and can no longer be ignored as it affects the global economy.

Key challenges related to an ageing population

These changing demographics represent risks for society as whole, for companies as well as for governments. This is not a temporary bubble, rather an unprecedented shift in global demographics. One of the most serious consequences of an older age structure is that it undermines existing social security systems. “There is a widening gap between what the governments needs to spend on public services for an ageing population, and the amount of tax revenue it is able to generate from its working population,” Julius Baer analyst Fabiano Vallesi notes. Many countries are trying to stave off these impending problems, notably by raising the retirement age or cutting pension benefits. Another source of concern is that a shrinking number of people in the workforce implies less economic output, resulting in a decrease in gross domestic product (GDP). However, there is a silver lining in these shifting demographics – the emergence of the “silver consumer.” An increasing number of seniors continue to work to some extent after 60, continuing to contribute as taxpayers, and most over-60 are also quite affluent with active lifestyles and an increasingly youthful mindset and discerning tastes.

A wealthy generation in retirement

With no children left in the household, and an abundance of free time and considerable disposable income, most senior citizens in developed markets are well off, with much higher asset ownerships and savings levels than the younger age groups. Thirty years ago, there were no ‘aged economies’ where consumption by older people exceeded that of the younger generations. In 2010, there were 23 aged economies and by 2040 that figure is estimated at 89. Personal spending carried out by the over-50s in the UK is, for example, higher than that of the under-50s. In the US the spending patterns are similar: Expenditure peaks in the 55-64 age group, tracked by the 65-74 age group.

“The reason for this lies in the fact that during an individual’s working life, assets are accumulated, leaving net worth of households to move towards a peak around the age of retirement,” Vallesi explains. “The assets accumulated over the previous years are then drawn down in order to fund further consumption during long and uncertain post-retirement periods.” In the US, the above-55s remain the wealthiest age group and the median income of retirees is continuously rising. The median US household’s net worth rose in the age groups above 65 between 2000 and 2011, while it declined in all other age groups during the same period.

Wealthy silver consumers pampering their health

Silver consumers – defined as older than 60 years – unsurprisingly spend more on healthcare than any other age groups. Today, those over age 60 already incur nearly three-fifths of total US healthcare expenditure. Healthcare companies in the wider sense, including tech companies offering robotics helping seniors with their daily tasks to hearings aids and traditional pharmaceutical companies should, as a result, continue to see greater demand for their products and services in the coming decades.

But the silver consumers also spend overproportionately on housing, leisure and recreation compared to the younger generations. Long-term, it is likely that the successful companies of the future are those that understand the needs of the silver consumers. “The challenge for all companies will be to develop products and services that will help fulfil the needs of the ageing populations,” Vallesi adds.

Japan, which has the world’s oldest population with over a quarter of its population age 65 or older, is the leading ‘silver consumer’ market, and as such has conducted much research to better understand the attitudes and behaviours of its older shoppers. Japanese companies are embracing the silver market phenomenon, coming up with product and service innovations."
